# pH-of-coffee-Experimental
This is may final project in class CPE353 Design of experimental 

### Objectives

What is significant to pH of coffee betwwem coffee grind and coffee roast
### Result and conclusion

There are many kinds of coffe today. We perform this experiment to find out which is significant to pH of coffee. There are 3 Factors to be considered in this experiment. The first factor is the size of coffee grind. From the experiment and analysis, we can see that size of coffee grind doesn't have a significant effect to the pH of coffee. For the second factor which is type of coffee roast. This factor has the significant effect to the response. From the analysis, we can see that, different types of roast clearly give different value of pH. We also considered the effect of the interaction between each factor. From the result, the interaction between grind and roast which is not significant to effect.
